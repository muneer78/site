[Abdelrahman Zeitoun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitoun_%28book%29) is a Syrian American businessman who spent the days after Katrina paddling around New Orleans in a canoe, saving elderly people and feeding stranded pets. His efforts were brought to a halt when he was detained by the Bush administration on suspicion of being a terrorist.

Here is an [earlier story](http://www.nola.com/living/t-p/index.ssf?/base/living-13/1247548888260380.xml&coll=1) about Zeitoun's exploits. Zeitoun also [wrote](http://blog.nola.com/bourbon/2005/11/rescue_efforts_lead_to_arrest.html) about his experiences during Katrina and about being detained.  

You can [see Zeitoun talking about his ordeal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOgLqUWnn5k) here. Eggers, like with his last book, has set up a [foundation](http://www.zeitounfoundation.org/index.html) in Zeitoun's name where the profits from the book will go to help Katrina's victims.
