[First](https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/how-trump-ruined-my-relationship-with-my-white-mother-1797935049), how a black man and his white mother became estranged because of Trump:

> The next day, my mother showed her entire ass. She basically became Trump, in my own house. My mother decided to don that bright-red “Make America Great Again” T-shirt and asked me to take her out to places while she had that shirt on, putting me in a position of having to appear to support Trump’s election. Again, I put my pride to the side. It’s my mother. She _birthed_ me.

[Second](https://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978), an important point for those who always agree to disagree:

> I’m sure you’ve heard the expression ‘everyone is entitled to their opinion.’ Perhaps you’ve even said it yourself, maybe to head off an argument or bring one to a close. Well, as soon as you walk into this room, it’s no longer true. You are not entitled to your opinion. You are only entitled to what you can argue for.

[Third](https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/art-of-not-having-opinions.html), you don’t need to have an opinion on everything that’s going on:

> It’s perfectly okay to say “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion on that” to those who are desperate to engage in some bad faith discourse on the wild headline of the day.
