[Gen. Mark Milley Delivers Powerful Defense of Studying Critical Race Theory](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/mark-milley-critical-race-theory-congress-1188508/):

> What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind. I do want to analyze it. It’s important that we understand it. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and guardians — they come from the American people. It’s important that the leaders, now and in the future, understand it.

I wish more people had this view today.
