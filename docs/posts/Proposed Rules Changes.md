<div class="paragraph">This proposal is in conjunction with the keeper change proposed above.<br /><br />Keepers are assigned to the round they were drafted in for the following year. The draft round assignment goes up by one until the keeper must go back into the draft. A keeper must go back into the draft even if he is traded in his final season of eligibility.<br /><br />E.g. Yoan Moncada gets drafted in the 12th round in 2018. He can then be kept as an 11th rounder in 2019, 10th rounder in 2020, and 9th rounder in 2021. Even if Moncada is traded to another team in 2021, he would have to go back into the draft in 2022.</div>
