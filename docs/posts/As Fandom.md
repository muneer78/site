I have to admit something shameful from my past. In 2001, I attempted to switch my fandom to the A's.

It was a different time. Billy Beane was fleecing the Royals over and over. All of our best players were in Oakland. I was living in the Bay Area that summer and going to games at the Coliseum. Unlike Odysseus, I succumbed to the siren song.

It didn't take obviously, but it still haunts me.
