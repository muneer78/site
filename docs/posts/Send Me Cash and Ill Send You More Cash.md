This woman called in wanting me to contact a lender who had not sent her money from a loan she was promised. The woman had seen a commercial about real estate investing. This commercial directed viewers to contact a specific lender to get the loans they needed to begin living their dreams. After doing some research and finding the lender on LendingTree.com, the woman determined that the lender was "legit".

**Me**: Well, what did you use as collateral?<br>
**Woman**: They said that I needed to send them $3,000 as collateral and they would send me the $35,000 they promised me.<br>
**Me**: Wait a second, you used cash as collateral for the loan? That doesn't make any sense.

But wait, it gets worse. Once the woman contacted the loan company and sent the cash, they stopped taking her calls.

**Woman**: I need to pay these loans by Friday.<br>
**Me**: Who did you borrow from?<br>
**Woman**: I took out payday loans for the money.<br>
**Me**: You did what?<br>
**Woman**: I was going to pay the payday loans back when I got the money from the loan company and use the rest to start investing in real estate.<br>
**Me**: I hate to tell you this, but you've been defrauded by these people.<br>
**Woman**: But they were on LendingTree.com!
