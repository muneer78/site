When I went on a cruise with my in-laws, we had walkie talkies so we could talk to each other and plan what to do each day without having to meet up. I insisted on being called Brown Whale at all times when I was being walkie-talkied.

On Day 3, my mother in law gets on and asks, "Muneer, is [wife's] cruise ID in the room?" No answer. She asks again. Still no answer. Finally, I hear this huge sigh and she says, "Ugh. Brown Whale, is [wife's] cruise ID in the room?". I pop on all chipper and said, "Yes! Yes it is!"
