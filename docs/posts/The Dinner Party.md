<strong>[Friend]:</strong> We'll bring something nice to eat. I'm not sure what, though. Any suggestions?<br>
<strong>Muneer:</strong> I believe you should bring king prawns simmered in butter and curry powder.<br>
<strong>[Friend]:</strong> But [Other Friend] and [Other Friend] are vegetarians!<br>
<strong>Muneer:</strong> True, so you should also bring naan for their lentil curry and my prawns.
