Everyone knows I love a good rap song translation.

Here's one of [Bandz A Make Her Dance by Juicy J](https://web.archive.org/web/20201025030230/http://adanai.com/bandz-a-make-her-dance/): 

> Calling what I’ve spent on the women at this club a “tip” offends my sensibilities, considering it’s more than the average person sees in a year. If I haven’t already made it abundantly clear, allow me to spell it out: I’m rich—like, Bill Gates rich. To wit, the highest paid player on the Buffalo Bills doesn’t hold a candle to my nest egg. In summation, I’m as rich as Bill Gates, richer than the Buffalo Bills and my “tips” pay the bills so please address me as Bill henceforth.
