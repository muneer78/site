[This](https://www.nooctothorpe.com/blog/2021/6/4/hey-so-i-think-i-fucking-hate-the-internet) is a very accurate reflection of my feelings about the Internet at large: 

> This is all exacerbated by the fact that the current state of the Internet and social media essentially renders it an emotional outlet plugged directly into each personâ€™s id. It rewards extreme behavior, and people crave to be a part of something bigger than themselves, so of course they get pulled into taking part in a mob of like-minded individuals who are all saying similar things. It's easy to get swept up in a sea of validation. I found myself there so many times, and only later, once the storm dissipated, did I sit back and consider the consequences of my own actions in that situation.
