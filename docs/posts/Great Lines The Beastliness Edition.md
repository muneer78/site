[Second](https://gen.medium.com/a-message-to-the-class-of-2020-please-destroy-the-world-374fde3b0485), a message to the 2020 graduates:

> Who has time for grace right now? Who has time for grace or patience when the world has been blown to shit? All through the pandemic, I’ve seen ads and billboards and yard signs saying that we Americans are in this together, and that it’s on us to beat back the coronavirus and come out the other side stronger than ever. Why is it always on us? Why is it never on THEM? Why aren’t the people who let this virus rip apart bodies and fortunes taking responsibility for their negligence?
> 
> I’ll tell you why: Because they want you to be survivors on their terms and their terms only. They want you to suck up what’s happened, then carry on as if it never did. They’re counting on it, both personally and financially. You are their human capital stock. They’d like things to go back to exactly the way they were, and they want to create the illusion that this would be a happy development. Imagine the gall it takes to don a Minnesota smile and appoint yourself shepherd to a generation you just bilked and left for dead.

[Third](https://kottke.org/20/06/law-professor-skillfully-handles-a-black-lives-matter-complaint-from-her-students), a law professor claps back on some cowardly students who wrote her an anonymous memo about wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt:

> Your use of hyperbolic rhetoric throughout the memo suggests that you really are angry about more than just a T-shirt. If it really is about just the T-shirt, then by overgeneralizing from a specific occurrence, your message is swamped by exaggeration. If it really is about other “conduct” on my part, I can’t tell what that is. By the end of the memo you have lost focus completely, generalizing (in statements that are unexplained and inexplicable) about bar passage and about the faculty and administration of the entire law school.
