Samantha Bee is one of the funniest people out there today. You may not agree with her political views, but [her book](https://bookshop.org/books/i-know-i-am-but-what-are-you/9781439142745) is filled with some great lines:

>Who among us didn’t enjoy unwinding with liquor and smokes in the company of unsupervised children?

---

>They were about to explain the fundamentals of lesbian sex to two impressionable nine-year-olds, and they had to do it in such a way that minimal information would be supplied but no further questions would arise.

---
>Hitting puberty excavated a wellspring of evil energy in me that led me to the discovery that my parents were vulnerable and had made mistakes that could be exploited in an interesting way.

---

>Sadness wafted everywhere you turned.

---

>The fastidious gay man I worked with went limp with “the vapors.” When he recovered his senses, his disgust was electrifying.
