This woman went to Odessa, TX and booked a three night stay at a budget motel. The premises were apparently so unsafe that she was forced to stay inside her room for the majority of the day. When she did go out once a day for ice, she had to be escorted by a member of the hotel staff. Of course, she wanted the hotel to compensate her for "pain and suffering". Naturally, some questions arose.

**Me**: Why didn't you go to another motel?<br>
**Woman**: Well, I had a reservation for three nights.<br>
**Me**: There are other motels in Odessa. It's not a small town.<br>
**Woman**: But I was so scared! I suffered a lot of emotional pain.<br>
**Me**: You could have gone elsewhere.<br>
**Woman**: Really? I thought you couldn't do that if you had a reservation.<br>
