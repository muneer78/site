One time, my dad was talking to some other "uncles" at a party about how great it was back "home". As they kept talking, the insults of how godless and goodbye the US was started.

After a few minutes of listening to this nonsense, I asked, "If it's so great back home, them why are all of you here?" All the uncles were incensed about my rudeness. I was told to go to my room.

Don't let your parents argue it's so great back home. If it was, then they would have stayed there.
