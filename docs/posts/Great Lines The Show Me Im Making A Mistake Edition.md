I have a mixed relationship with what people would call self-help. I think most of it is bogus nonsense. But there are some people who make sense. The point here is that there aren't any absolutes. There is usually at least a modicum of value in most things.

[First](https://bookshop.org/books/tools-of-titans-the-tactics-routines-and-habits-of-billionaires-icons-and-world-class-performers/9781328683786), a quote about failing to achieve goals.

>If anyone can refute me—show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective—I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone.
