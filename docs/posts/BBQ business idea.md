**Muneer**:  Steve and I have decided to embark upon a new business venture that we just realized has been approved by God.&nbsp;We are going to tailgate Covid vaccine lines and sell tasty ribs, sausages and hot links to the unwashed masses. The name of our business will be a combo of our names: Steer. God gave us both the perfect names to combine into a name for a predatory BBQ business.<br>
**Wife**: Whoâ€™s doing the cooking?<br>
**Muneer**: We're looking into the exciting world of undocumented labor to procure our pitmaster.<br>
**Steve**: It's nice to finally have a purpose in life. I've coasted aimlessly for so long.<br>
**Muneer**: Me too, brother. Me too.
