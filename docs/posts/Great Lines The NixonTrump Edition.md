I’ve recently been watching a lot of the original “Head of the Class” series on HBO Max.  This type of nostalgia has been very prevalent in my life recently.

Over the past 3 months, I indulged in a very self reflective exercise. I found all of the links I’ve felt were worth saving, scattered all across various online repositories. I got all of the links together, tagged them with their subject, and organized them in the way I’d always dreamed of. It gave me a small bit of control in an uncontrollable time. When all was said and done, I had almost 29,500 links catalogued.

For those who are interested, you can see almost all of the links here. Feel free to use it as a way to find interesting stuff to read. If the link is broken, just enter it into the Internet Archive.

And now, on to the Great Lines.

[First](https://designmom.com/the-consequences-of-your-actions/), a blogger responds to people telling her to stick to [insert non-political subject]:

> Do  you think I care about losing you as a follower? I do not. Not one bit.  I will actively block you on Instagram if I know you’re a Trump  supporter. You unfollowing me doesn’t hurt me in any way. I literally —  in the true sense of the word — won’t notice you are gone.
> 
> You can’t support Trump and also be a decent human being. You can’t support Trump and earn my respect.

[Second](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/), this obituary of Richard Nixon by Hunter S. Thompson can likely be reprinted with “Nixon” replaced by Trump when that wonderful day arrives:

> He  has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic  case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our  nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a  brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States,  by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the  heart of the American Dream.

[Third](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-wile-e-coyote-explains-the-world-1752248034), a classic line from an essay about the classic comics of Wile E. Coyote:

> …your  mind is a baffling supercomputer nevertheless hopelessly inadequate to  the task of understanding the full terrible complexity of the world  around you.
