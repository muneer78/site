[Banknotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote) are a fascinating look into the artistry and culture of the countries of the world.

To get started, you can spend hours exploring [Ron Wise's database](http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/), [Tom Chao's galleries](http://www.tomchao.com/), [Islamic Bank Notes](http://www.islamicbanknotes.com/), [KCShop's gallery](http://www.kcshop.com/imagegallery/), and [ATS Notes](http://www.atsnotes.com/catalog/catalog.html).  

There are several resources for collectors as well, [here](http://www.collectpapermoney.com/) and [here](http://www.banknotes.com/images.htm).  

For some of the artistic elements of paper money, you can read [Michael Bierut's analysis of the best and worst paper money](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200906u/currency), the [designs](http://www.ryanriegner.com/new-philippines-currency/) of the new Philippine bank notes, a [primer on paper money art](http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/5440/money-design-and-history.html), see some [downright weird and amazing uses](http://www.ragandbone.com/blog/?cat=831) for paper money in art, and a [group of collages](http://mocoloco.com/art/archives/002478.php#more) made or influenced by currency.  

For the citizens of the Commonwealth among us, [see](http://www.pjsymes.com.au/qe2/) how Queen Elizabeth II's portrait has changed on the face of the various Commonwealth nations' currencies.
