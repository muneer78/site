<p>From Eric Barker's book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/barking-up-the-wrong-tree-the-surprising-science-behind-why-everything-you-know-about-success-is-mostly-wrong/9780062416049">Barking Up the Wrong Tree</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know plenty of people for whom grit is a liability because it allows them to stick with something that makes them or others miserable and towards no long-term good aim.</p>
</blockquote>

Kenny Rogers also put it well:
>You got to know when to hold 'em,<br>
Know when to fold 'em,<br>
Know when to walk away,<br>
And know when to run.<br>
