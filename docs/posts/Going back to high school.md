A conversation I had with my pal, Lora a couple of years ago, when we'd both reached our 40s.

**Lora**: I'd be so much better and popular if I went back to high school now.

**Muneer**: Yeah, but then the most popular jock would pull a *She's All That* on you.

**Lora**: Say what?

**Muneer**: He'd pretend to be into you and make you his girlfriend as part of a bet with the other popular kids. But then he'd end up actually liking you. It would all culminate in him telling you that he couldn't take you to prom while 98 Degrees" "The Hardest Thing" played in the background.

**Lora**: LOL. That's so messed up!!!
