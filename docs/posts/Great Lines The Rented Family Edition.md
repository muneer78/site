By the time you read this, I will have had some eye surgery. So this newsletter may or may not be getting sent to you from a blind man. :)

[First](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2021/05/16/thoughts-on-the-imminent-unmasking/), John Scalzi accurately captures my feelings about people who refuse to wear masks:

> ...at this point if you are choosing to be unvaccinated because of a political position or because “you don’t trust the science” or whatever dimwit rationale you have, you’re being an asshole, and if you get sick, I’m not going to waste any sympathy on you. My sympathy at this point is for the people the willfully unvaccinated are going out of their way to endanger, namely, the people who genuinely can’t get the vaccine for medical reasons, whose lives will still be curtailed because some of us have decided being a shitty person about COVID is a legitimate social and political stance. Hey! Stop being an asshole about this. Get vaccinated.

[Second](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry), you can apparently rent families in Japan to help avoid socially awkward situations:

>Terai searched YouTube for tear-inducing videos, and found a Thai life-insurance commercial about a girl who didn’t appreciate the love of her deaf-mute father. Terai cried, and felt that a burden had been lifted.

[Third](https://medium.com/aeon-magazine/escape-the-echo-chamber-7ce91164421c), it's very easy to fall prey to conspiracy theories and faulty thinking:

>all it takes to enter an echo chamber is a momentary lapse of intellectual vigilance. Once you’re in, the echo chamber’s belief systems function as a trap, making future acts of intellectual vigilance only reinforce the echo chamber’s worldview.
