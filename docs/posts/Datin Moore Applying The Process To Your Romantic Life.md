<p>Hi Dayton,</p>

<p>I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years. She claimed that I never fully committed to the relationship, and let me go. She was a Latino chick who worked as a prison therapist. My friends are now saying that I need a younger, granola chick. Do you agree?</p>

<p>Dumped In Denver</p>

<p>Dayton: DID, this past offseason, I decided that we needed to trade Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, and Mike Montgomery to the Rays for James Shields and Wade Davis. Many people are criticizing this great trade because they say I was fixated on getting a pitcher who could be labeled an "ace". Well, you know what? That trade is an unqualified winner! Shields should have gone to the All Star Game.</p>

<p>So, let me take you back to the 2004 season. Right before the trade deadline, the OLD front office orchestrated a 3 team trade with the A's and Astros. We got Mark Teahen, John Buck, and Mike Wood, the Astros got Carlos Beltran, and the A's got Octavio Dotel. Looking back, this was an unusually bad haul. The OLD front office mandated that any Beltran trade had to get a third baseman and a catcher back. Since the A's had Mark Teahen and the Astros had Buck, the OLD front office made the deal. They were shortsighted in thinking they needed to get specific position players back, rather than just going for the best overall return. When I got here and instituted The Processâ„¢, all that wrong headed thinking was replaced with effective scouting and a focus on the right types of players.</p>

<p>So, you need to find the best overall girl for you. It doesn't matter if she's a "granola" or a "preppie". She just has to be the best overall talent. Just look at what I did in the 2006 Draft. Wait, on second thought, don't....</p>
