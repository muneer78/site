The pilots at some airline had what was called a non qualified 401k. That's where the company can fund it, but it goes poof if there's a bankruptcy. This airline had just gone bankrupt.

Well, the way this plan's document was written, the non-qualified balance would become guaranteed if the employee got a divorce.

So the pilots all got together and simultaneously got divorces from their wives, filed the paperwork to get the dough guaranteed, and then got remarried after it went through.
