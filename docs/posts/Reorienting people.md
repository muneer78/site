Back in the day, when I was working at the law firm, I was the one who would go around and try to get a consensus on which restaurant we'd order lunch from.

All people would tell me is what they didn't want. Eventually, I got frustrated and started saying, "You have to tell me what you do want. Stop being part of the problem and become part of the solution!!"
