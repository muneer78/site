<p>I have this co-worker on a team full of people who manufacture idiotic crises that don't actually matter.</p>

<p>I was talking to her on Friday and she was talking about how vital she was to the company because she'd caught a potentially catastrophic error caused in part by her team's unwillingness to improve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a later conversation about this conversation with another co-worker, I said, "Yeah. We find our heroes where we can. Some people rescue children from burning buildings, others work with Covid patients. Nadine saves us from non-issues that everyone will forget about in 2 hours."</p>

<p>She had me on speaker. She said her fiancee fell off his chair laughing when he heard it.</p>
