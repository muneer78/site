**Steve**: Donkey nannies are pretty cool.<br>
**Lisette**: I am also too young, small and adorable for journeys. I want a donkey nanny.<br>
**Muneer**: I would place some of those old school saddles on my donkey with the bags on each side. One side would have carrots and the other would have apples. We'd take day-long walks in the countryside and enjoy each other's company.<br>
**Lisette**: That got a little too romantic at the end.<br>
**Steve**: The other option was overtly sexual. There was no third path.
