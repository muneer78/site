<p>I love <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-watch-basketball-like-a-genius/9781419744808">this quote</a> about Wilt Chamberlain:</p>

<p>"He portrays himself as both the main character of mid century America and a bemused loner who just wants to hang out in his mansion festooned in ethically sourced Arctic wolf hair."</p>
