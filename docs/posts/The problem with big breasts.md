A [great comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vc6ky/do_you_want_me_to_look_at_your_breasts_or_do_you/c53bibq/) from a woman on Reddit about the problems with big breasts:

> I have a slight problem with this picture, so bare with me for a moment while I explain it as best as I can.
> 
> Imagine you have an abnormally large package. Think large enough that it is quite prominently visible through all the jeans you own.
> 
> Before you go to school, your dad makes you run upstairs and change because if people see your big package they'll think you're a slut. He is constantly telling you to adjust your pants so your package doesn't show, or else people are going to think you only want sex. He constantly warns you that if you show off your package, homosexual men may think you are interested and rape you. You go out one night wearing tight jeans because you want to show off your big package, and your dad sees your outfit and tells you that if you get assraped by a gay man you will have deserved it for dressing so slutty.
> 
> You do a great job at work, but your peers get promoted before you because your boss assumes that since your package shows and you occasionally talk to the women in the office you must care about sex more than your job.
> 
> You get a different job, one in which your elderly, married boss is constantly leering at your crotch and calling you into her office for no apparent reason. You struggle to turn down her constant advances without insulting her, because you really can't afford to lose your job.
> 
> You notice people noticing throughout your whole life, and it is making you self conscious since you are obviously different from them and it is getting hard to maintain a conversation when their eyes kept darting to your large package that is showing through your jeans. So you think to yourself "well this is simple, I will go buy different jeans."
> 
> You go to the store, and you try on every pair of pants in sight. Unfortunately, the majority of them are obviously designed for people who do not have abnormally large packages, like so. Obviously, today's style is based on shitty rock bands. It's okay because you don't particularly care about looking like you're in a rock band, but you're having a hard time finding any jeans that AREN'T cut that skinny.
> 
> Finally, in one of the small back stores, you find a bunch of jeans that aren't cut to be super stylish but instead are pretty normal looking. You try them on, but your package is so big they might as well be skinny jeans on you!
> 
> Finally, after hours of shopping, you find a pair of pants of pants loose enough to make your enormous package less prominent, but at this point you are feeling so defeated you do not bother buying them.
> 
> You take a few of your older pants in to get tailored and they look pretty good, but it too expensive for you to do to all of your pants so in the end you only have two pairs that are flattering. You spend the rest of your time lamenting the fact that you really should feel flattered that so many people want to look at your package, but it is only making you feel self conscious and ostracized by the constant focus towards your crotch.
> 
> ...THAT is what it is like having big breasts.
> 
> For the record, I'm not trying to complain to say it's always a bad thing! Breasts are awesome, in all shapes and sizes. I just get tired of hearing "if you didn't want attention, you'd cover them up". Yeah, let's see YOU try to find a tshirt big enough to hold my breasts that doesn't also fall down to my knees. For the most part, my breasts are going to show more than other peoples because they are bigger than other people's and don't fit into clothes the same way. Just be aware that the bigger a deal you make of it, the more I'm going to be aware of the attention and want to hide them. If I wasn't so trained to be aware of my breasts (not just by men but from friends, and my mother especially), my natural state would to have them showing in all of their glorious voluptuousness because that's how just about every shirt I pick up from the store is going to fit me.
