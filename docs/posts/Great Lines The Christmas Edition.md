[First](https://www.theroot.com/the-caucasians-guide-to-thanksgiving-part-2-the-menu-1820676919), some important distinctions between dressing and stuffing at Thanksgiving:

> I  personally believe that the continued ingestion of stuffing can lead to  behavioral changes like the inability to recognize the downbeat or the  desire to masturbate publicly. I’m just saying, I’ve eaten dressing all  my life and have never once felt the desire to masturbate in a room with  more than one person. Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and Mark Halperin  ate stuffing all their lives, and look what happened.

[Second](https://www.theroot.com/the-caucasian-s-guide-to-black-christmas-1821454271), as someone who never understood why parents would give a fictional fat white dude for the presents they bought with their hard earned money, I entirely agree with this statement:

> This is why black parents always end the charade and let their children know that, like Chicago’s “gang thugs,” All Lives Matter and trickle-down economics, Santa is a figment of the white imagination.

[Third](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html), an important point about how to really seek truth:

> Without  this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly independent-minded.  It's not enough just to have resistance to being told what to think.  Those kind of people reject conventional ideas only to replace them with  the most random conspiracy theories. And since these conspiracy  theories have often been manufactured to capture them, they end up being  less independent-minded than ordinary people, because they're subject  to a much more exacting master than mere convention.
