<p>A man called in the day after Barack Obama was elected President in 2008. Obama's victory had convinced this man that the U.S. would soon become &nbsp;a "Socilist" haven that would target God fearing people such as himself. So, this man decided he wanted to emigrate to Ireland.</p>

**Man**: So, do I call the U.S. Embassy in Ireland about this?<br />
**Me**: No, you have to contact the Irish Embassy here in the U.S.<br />
**Man**: Really? Why? I'm an American citizen.<br />
**Me**: Because if you're trying to emigrate to Ireland, you need to ask them what their laws and regulations are to enable you to do so. The U.S. Embassy can only counsel you about matters pertaining to this country. Besides, wouldn't that be akin to sleeping with the enemy?<br />
**Me**: I never thought of it that way!</p>
