<h1>Codex Vitae</h1>

<h2>How to Use This Codex</h2>

<p>If you are Muneer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.</li>
	<li>Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?</li>
	<li>Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not Muneer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read this with the understanding that you are different than Muneer— the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.</li>
	<li>Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In General</h2>

<h3>Meta-beliefs</h3>

<p>Beliefs about beliefs.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Perceptions color beliefs in a way that prevents humans from having identical beliefs.</li>
	<li>No belief is absolutely correct.</li>
	<li>Beware of anyone who is totally convinced that their beliefs are correct.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<p>Fundamentals that guide my life.</p>

<h4>Personal</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Never stop learning new things.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Society</h4>

<ul>
	<li>There should be no group or insitution that is absolutely insulated from criticism.</li>
	<li>There needs to be an adequate safety net to help people who are experiencing tough times.
	<ul>
		<li>This includes not cutting off benefits to people when they begin working again, but do not yet have the resources to have minimal financial security.</li>
		<li>There should be an incentive for people to work.
		<ul>
			<li>This means that we need to do things like give retraining to people in dying industries.</li>
			<li>It does not mean increasingly draconian cuts to public assistance.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We need to encourage people to acquire skills that will keep them working.
	<ul>
		<li>Sinecures should be eliminated wherever they are found.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We need to reduce the amount of no-value adding bureaucracy.
	<ul>
		<li>Regulations need to be put up for periodic review in front of a citizen committee that contains as much diversity of viewpoints as possible.</li>
		<li>The law needs to be simplified to a level where it can be understood by an educated layperson</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>There needs to be a minimum expected level of competence for adults.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Politics</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Elections should be publicly funded in full.
	<ul>
		<li>There should also be a cap on how much can be spent on elections. The amounts can increase as the level of the election changes. For example, a person running for a county office should not be spending at the level of someone running for state office.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
