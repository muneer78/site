I meant to send the following as the prelude to the newsletter you were sent this past week.

I've decided to find a new job. I saw that my current job was evolving in a way that I would eventually not enjoy the work at all. So I took the affirmative step of finding a new job before I was forced to do so.

Leaving a job is never easy. I'm applying to jobs in my current company, but also looking outside. This is honestly the first time I've made the decision to leave a job, rather than being laid off or the company folding. It's been empowering. I can choose the next step in my career rather than having it chosen for me.

So, if you know of any potential jobs I'd be good for or know people I can talk to, please let me know.

UPDATE: 
The worker shortage is real. In the 3 weeks I've been applying, I've gotten 3 interviews and they've all gone to a second interview. I've never been this in demand in the job market.

If a yahoo like me can get this much interest, then so can you. If you are feeling like you could use a change, there may not be a better time to look for a new job. And on the plus side, you'll likely get paid more at a new job.
