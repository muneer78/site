The A's to Sacramento is a done deal. An MLB team will play in front of a 10000 person capacity crowd for the 2025-27 seasons.

They get to share the stadium with the Giants AAA team. I'd see about trading affiliates so that they can have their own minor leaguers ready to join the team at all times.

I'm picturing calls like this from the A's GM to a player:
GM: "Hey, Shea Langeliers is stuck in traffic. How about making your major league debut today??
Player: "My mother in law's in town and I have to mow the lawn. Ask me again next week."
