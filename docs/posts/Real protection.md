I'm going to acquire a taxidermied white man to help me avoid unwanted interactions with the police.

This led to the following exchange in the Facebook comments:

**Steve**: You realize that literally everyone will assume that it's your sex doll, right?<br>
**Me**: Have you learned nothing from the pioneering work of Bernie Lomax in this field?<br>
**Steve**: The schlubs in Weekend at Bernie's needed the constant presence of the corpse of a beloved Hampton Islands social fixture in order to keep them safe from what they thought was an active contract on their lives. You will only have 'Jeremy'; the creepily real sex doll that everyone knows about but nobody acknowledges.*
*except for when a co-worker approaches you and says, "You are NOT bringing 'Jeremy' to the holiday party. This is not a request."<br>
**Muneer**: So you're saying I'm going to become Lars and the Real Girl?<br>
**Steve**: I'm telling you this because I care.
