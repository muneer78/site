<p>A pal of mine is an attorney, and was doing a deposition related to a mesothelioma case in Illinois.</p>

<p>He asked the witness how long he worked each day. The guy replied, “You want to know how long I worked, or how long I clocked in?” My friend asked him to explain.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d clock in at 8am, then go have some coffee and read the paper,” he said. “After doing that, it was time for lunch, so we’d all go to a bar and have a few drinks. I came back around 2pm and checked to make sure my machine was working OK. Then I went home and took a nap. I came back at 4.30 to clock out.”</p>

<p>“So how long did you actually work on a normal day?” my friend asked. “About 40-45 minutes,” the witness replied.</p>
