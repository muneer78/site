[In 2010, Matt Taibbi went to a Tea Party rally and saw the people who later voted Trump into office](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-truth-about-the-tea-party-188228/):

> Scanning the thousands of hopped-up faces in the crowd, I am immediately struck by two things. One is that there isn’t a single black person here. The other is the truly awesome quantity of medical hardware: Seemingly every third person in the place is sucking oxygen from a tank or propping their giant atrophied glutes on motorized wheelchair-scooters. As Palin launches into her Ronald Reagan impression — “Government’s not the solution! Government’s the problem!” — the person sitting next to me leans over and explains.

> “The scooters are because of Medicare,” he whispers helpfully. “They have these commercials down here: ‘You won’t even have to pay for your scooter! Medicare will pay!’ Practically everyone in Kentucky has one.”
> 
> A hall full of elderly white people in Medicare-paid scooters, railing against government spending and imagining themselves revolutionaries as they cheer on the vice-presidential puppet hand-picked by the GOP establishment. If there exists a better snapshot of everything the Tea Party represents, I can’t imagine it.
> 
> After Palin wraps up, I race to the parking lot in search of departing Medicare-motor-scooter conservatives. I come upon an elderly couple, Janice and David Wheelock, who are fairly itching to share their views.
> 
> “I’m anti-spending and anti-government,” crows David, as scooter-bound Janice looks on. “The welfare state is out of control.”
> 
> “OK,” I say. “And what do you do for a living?”
> 
> “Me?” he says proudly. “Oh, I’m a property appraiser. Have been my whole life.”
> 
> I frown. “Are either of you on Medicare?”
> 
> Silence: Then Janice, a nice enough woman, it seems, slowly raises her hand, offering a faint smile, as if to say, _You got me!_
> 
> “Let me get this straight,” I say to David. “You’ve been picking up a check from the government for decades, as a _tax assessor_, and your wife is on Medicare. How can you complain about the welfare state?”
> 
> “Well,” he says, “there’s a lot of people on welfare who don’t deserve it. Too many people are living off the government.”
> 
> “But,” I protest, “_you_ live off the government. And have been your whole life!”
> 
> “Yeah,” he says, “but I don’t make very much.”
