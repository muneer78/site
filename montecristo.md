# Count of Monte Cristo

I’m stealing this idea from James Clear. I want to begin reviewing books so that I can actually remember what I liked about them and any insights they provided to me.

The Book in 3 Sentences:

*   One can overcome misfortunes caused by one’s enemies by listening to the right mentors.
*   Play the long game when putting your plans into action.
*   You have to preserve your humanity and consider how your actions may affect innocent parties.

Summary: this includes quotes only this time. I’ll put in personal notes for future books.

*   “Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.” “Two years!” exclaimed Dantes; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”
*   “Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”
*   “For all evils there are two remedies – time and silence.” “It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising”
*   It’s necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live.”
*   “All human wisdom is contained in these two words – Wait and Hope”
